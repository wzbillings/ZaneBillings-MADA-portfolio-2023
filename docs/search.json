    "text": "My backstory\nI have undergrad degrees in math and biology from the best school ever, Western Carolina University (GO CATS! üòª). I already took this class ‚Äî if you look hard enough you can probably find all my stuff from then! I‚Äôve also taken a lot of other statistics classes (and a few programming classes too), and I use R almost every day. So hopefully I‚Äôll be able to help with any problems that y‚Äôall have. I am hoping to improve my skills on debugging problems and communicating with students in this course üòÅ.\nThe fun fact I always share is that I have a certificate from the state of Montana that says I can distinguish between black bears and grizzly bears. I‚Äôve never been to Montana, I got the certificate online.\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs one of my favorite data-analysis-related comics.\n\n\nI spend a lot of time trying to tell people that no amount of statistics can fix messed-up data! Truly it is one of the plights of the modern statistician. If you want to go to the comic source, you can go here."

My meetings will be\n\nWednesday at 1:00 pm for odd-numbered modules and\nThursday at 1:00 pm for even-numbered modules at\nhttps://zoom.us/my/wzbillings.\n\nSo hopefully between my office hour and Andreas‚Äô office hour, there will be a time that works for you. My first office hour will be Wednesday, January 11th, at 1:00 pm.\nFeel free to DM me in our slack group, or you can email me at Wesley.Billings@uga.edu. Though be advised that I never check my phone, so I am unlikely to see emails or slack messages outside of ‚Äúregular business hours‚Äù."

    "text": "Welcome to my website.\nHello, everyone! My name is Zane Billings, and I‚Äôm the TA for the MADA course for the Spring 2023 semester. I‚Äôm also a third-year PhD Student in the data analysis and modeling program working with Andreas. My work is about flu immunology and the seasonal flu shot.\n\n\n\nA picture of me, in my office, working on this website!\n\n\n\n\nMy backstory\nI have undergrad degrees in math and biology from the best school ever, Western Carolina University (GO CATS! üòª). I already took this class ‚Äî if you look hard enough you can probably find all my stuff from then! I‚Äôve also taken a lot of other statistics classes (and a few programming classes too), and I use R almost every day. So hopefully I‚Äôll be able to help with any problems that y‚Äôall have. I am hoping to improve my skills on debugging problems and communicating with students in this course üòÅ.\nIn my spare time I like to read (mainly fantasy and horror, but I read all kinds of different stuff) and game (I‚Äôm currently really into Oxygen Not Included). The fun fact I always share is that I have a certificate from the state of Montana that says I can distinguish between black bears and grizzly bears. I‚Äôve never been to Montana, I got the certificate online.\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs one of my favorite data-analysis-related comics.\n\n\nI spend a lot of time trying to tell people that no amount of statistics can fix messed-up data! Truly it is one of the plights of the modern statistician. If you want to go to the comic source, you can go here."

    "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Zane and I‚Äôll be the TA for MADA this semester. You can read some more about me on my About Me page!\nI‚Äôll host live/synchronous Zoom office hours once a week, similar to Andreas. My meetings will be\n\nWednesday at 1:00 pm for odd-numbered modules and\nThursday at 1:00 pm for even-numbered modules at\nhttps://zoom.us/my/wzbillings.\n\nSo hopefully between my office hour and Andreas‚Äô office hour, there will be a time that works for you. My first office hour will be Wednesday, January 11th, at 1:00 pm.\nFeel free to DM me in our slack group, or you can email me at Wesley.Billings@uga.edu. Though be advised that I never check my phone, so I am unlikely to see emails or slack messages outside of ‚Äúregular business hours‚Äù."

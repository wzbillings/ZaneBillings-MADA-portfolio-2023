# MY WEBSITE

### This is a level 3 header on Zane's website

On my website, I have **bold text**, **italic text**, ***text that is both***,
~~strikethroughs~~ and even ^superscripts^ and ~subscripts~.
We can even do `inline code` `r emoji::emoji("scream")`! But 
no underlines though.


* Please use the `Menu Bar` above to look around.
* Have fun!
* If you figure out underlines, let me know how! My contact info is
at [my website](https://wzbillings.com).

Hi everyone! My name is Zane and I'll be the TA for MADA this semester.

I'll host live/synchronous Zoom office hours once a week, similar to Andreas.
My meetings will be

* **Wednesday at 1:00 pm for odd-numbered modules** and
* **Thursday at 1:00 pm for even-numbered modules** at
* [https://zoom.us/my/wzbillings](https://zoom.us/my/wzbillings).

So hopefully between my office
hour and Andreas' office hour, there will be a time that works for you. My first office hour will be **Wednesday, January 11th, at 1:00 pm.**

Feel free to DM me in our slack group, or you can email me at
[Wesley.Billings@uga.edu](mailto:Wesley.Billings@uga.edu). Though be advised
that I never check my phone, so I am unlikely to see emails or slack messages
outside of "regular business hours".

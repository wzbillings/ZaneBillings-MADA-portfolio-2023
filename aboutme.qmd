# Welcome to my website.

Hello, everyone! My name is Zane Billings, and I'm the TA for the MADA course
for the Spring 2023 semester. I'm also a third-year PhD Student in the data
analysis and modeling program working with Andreas. My work is about flu
immunology and the seasonal flu shot.

# My backstory

I have undergrad degrees in math and biology from the best school
ever, Western Carolina University (GO CATS! `r emoji::emoji("smiling cat with heart-eyes")`). I already took this class --- if you look hard enough you
can probably find all my stuff from then! I've also taken
a lot of other statistics classes
(and a few programming classes too), and I use `R` almost every day. So
hopefully I'll be able to help with any problems that y'all have. I am
hoping to improve my skills on debugging problems and communicating with
students in this course `r emoji::emoji("grin")`.

The fun fact I always share is that I have a certificate from the state of
Montana that says I can distinguish between black bears and grizzly bears. I've
never been to Montana, I got the certificate online.

![Here's one of my favorite data-analysis-related comics.](static/comic.png){width=75%}

I spend a lot of time trying to tell people that no amount of statistics can
fix messed-up data! Truly it is one of the plights of the modern statistician.
